# xdViewer

## What is it ?

This is a simple web app with a file input. Once an XD selected, it parses it, displays the list of Artboards. Clicking an artboard displays it as SVG.

## Why ?

Because some of us don't have Macs, don't like Windows, but still need to work with Adobe XD files.

## How to use it

```
git clone git@github.com:selimachour/xdviewer.git
cd xdviwer
yarn
yarn devs
```

Also for fonts, add the required fonts in `/fonts` and include them in index.html

There is already an example

## Features

- View XD files locally (no uploading to a remote site)
- Display the Artboards
- Show properties of the various elements on click ... "OH! it's the same color with just some alpha !"
